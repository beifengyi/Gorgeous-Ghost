        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>"Gorgeous Ghost" respects user privacy. We are committed to protecting your personal information. As a single-player game, this application collects only the following necessary data for gameplay:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>User's level ID (solely for saving game progress, enabling continuation from where the user left off)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No other data (including but not limited to personal identification information, device details, or usage behavior) is collected, stored, or transmitted by the game.</p>
        
        <h2>Data Usage</h2>
        <p>The collected data is used exclusively for one purpose:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To save the user's game progress via level ID, ensuring the ability to resume gameplay from the last level reached</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Data Protection</h2>
        <p>We implement appropriate security measures to protect your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All data (level ID) is stored locally on the user's device only</li>
            <li>No data is uploaded to cloud servers or shared with any third parties</li>
            <li>No personal information is collected or processed at any stage</li>
        </ul>
